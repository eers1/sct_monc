# Stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition on MONC

This repository contains the design for perturbing six parameters from a base simulation of a stratocumulus-to-cumulus transition using the Met Office/NERC cloud model, MONC. Python scripts and Jupyter notebooks for processing the SCT data are also controlled here, some of which is generalised for all MONC output.
