Stratocumulus-to-cumulus transitions are driven by numerous interacting cloud-controlling factors, and understanding these interactions can improve the accuracy of cloud responses to climate changes in global climate models. Here, we analyse a perturbed parameter ensemble of large-eddy simulations that explore the transition in the North East Pacific.
